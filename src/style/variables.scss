// You gotta use sass vars for these because media queries wont let u use css vars
// Small mobile devices
$screen-sm-min: 23.4375rem; // 375px
// Small tablets
$screen-md-min: 48.375rem; // 744px
// Large tablets
$screen-lg-min: 75rem; // 1200px

/*
  CSS vars are much better today than ^, with the one xception of media queries which is still being debated.
  You can also change these with JS and they are encapsulated - you can edit them for only certain pats of the application
  I try and prefix everything with br so that if I wanted to add a style lib, there wont be collisions
    ie. Both me and the lib are trying to set the css var --primary-color, and therefore broken
